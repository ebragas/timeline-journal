# Timeline Journal
## Overview
How much of life is experienced and forgotten? How much would it mean to you to be able to review it through the journal entries, photos, and playlists that defined the moments of your life and to share those with the most important people around you? Our data tells a story and the timeline journaling method will help you weave the narrative together along with that data to create a picture that develops with you.

## TODOs
* Make it installable
* Create a UI (web based?)
